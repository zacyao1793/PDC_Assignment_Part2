"Greetings, traveler. Before we proceed, tell me, 
which of these forms will your soul inhabit? 
Will you be a mortal, one of the Deepkin who dwell beneath the waves, 
or perhaps a Feymour, touched by the magic of the faerie realms? 
Alternatively, will you take on the form of a Draconian, with scales as hard as steel, 
or a Celestial, born of the stars themselves?"
1. Mortal
2. Deepkin
3. Feymour
4. Draconian
5. Celestial
"Your journey begins now, traveler. Before we face the trials ahead, tell me, 
what calling has your soul heard? Will you wander as a Vagabond, seeking adventure in every corner of the land? 
Will you serve as a Ronin, a masterless samurai seeking redemption? 
Perhaps you are a Pagan, attuned to the spirits of the earth and sky. 
Or will you harness both magic and steel as a Spellblade? 
Maybe you have taken the mantle of a Witch Hunter, sworn to protect the realms from the dark forces that threaten them. 
Choose your path wisely, for it will determine your fate."
1. Vagabond
2. Ronin
3. Pagan
4. Spellblade
5. Witch Hunter
Ahhh Deepkin Pagan, what a brilliant choose! 
Your soul has found its vessel, and your journey has begun, adventurer. 
You have chosen your calling and your fate is now intertwined with the fabric of this world. 
May your footsteps be guided by the light of your convictions, 
and your blade strike true against the darkness that threatens us all.
